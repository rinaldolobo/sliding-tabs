# sliding_tabs
This repo consists of three different implementations of tabs:

1) Sliding tabs using bootstrap and jquery mobile.
  This is a basic implementation that uses jquery Mobile swipe feature in mobile as well as desktop and moves the focus to the next or previous slide depending on the direction of swipe. It uses bootstrap for responsive design and formatting.

2) Sliding tabs without bootstrap.
  This is a basic implementation that uses jquery Mobile swipe feature in mobile as well as desktop and moves the focus to the next or previous slide depending on the direction of swipe. It does not use bootstrap.

3) Sliding tabs(nested) without jquery mobile and bootstrap.
  This is a more complex implementation that uses a custom swipe event that detects swipe gesture in mobile and moves the focus to the next or previous slide depending on the direction of swipe. It also facilitates nesting of tabs upto level 4.
